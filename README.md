**Usage of code:**

1. visualisation
- *data-visualisation.ipynb* displays all the different distributions of the csv dataset
- *face-recognition-analysis.ipynb* shows a plot of the images on a graph, showing their similarities/differences to each other

2. Preprocessing
- *CSV_to_Dataset.ipynb* converts all the csv data into a Tensor object, one for training, one for testing
- *DataAug.ipynb* performs data augmentation to the Tensor object, and saving it as a new Tensr object
